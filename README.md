# OPforu Seeder
Performance optimized reference tracking seeder utility. Seeds 25k+ cross referenced data structures in under one second.

Using a batch & reference pointer methods to seed huge amounts of (purposeful) data in seconds

currently only works on my side project but the technique has been exceptionally proven. 

## Usage
pull down the repo and build the binary.

```bash
make build
```

or if you want to run it immediately

```bash
make run
```

Ensure you have the correct .env variables set to establish a connection to mongodb.
